##Structure
The system is developed on two open source project:

- [Gitlab](http://about.gitlab.com)
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org)

with the help of other python packages, such as

- web.py
- pymongo
- pandas

The system contains 4 parts, as shown in the graph.

- User communicate with the ___System Core___ for information and operations, e.g. import data set, get experiment information.
- User manage their experiment codes on ___Gitlab Server___ while each push operation triggers _System Core_ to clone and run the code if necessary.
- The _System Core_ communicates with ___MongoDB Server___ for management of data set and experiment data (metadata).
- The _System Core_ may access to a ___Large Scale Cluster___ for more computational power.

##Pipeline
The code manage and auto-run system runs in a pipeline as shown in the graph.

- User pushes code to GitLab Server, the server POST to system core through web hook.
- System core clones the repository to local directory.
- Read experiment info from `exp.json` and upload it into `users` db in MongoDB server.
- Copy experiment code to sandbox and run.
- Record output metadata from `output.json` into database in MongoDB server.
- Import output dataset (if any) into `datas` db in MongoDB server.
- Finishes.
